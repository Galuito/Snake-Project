# Welcome to the Snake Project!
In this repository you'll find all of my python modules related to learning how to use pygame and me discovering useful and ingenious integrations of methods, you'll notice that some files even have 'marks' which means that they have and upgraded version or simply that I found another way to integrate them into a module.
The final objective of this module is developing a snake game that has the basic features of one, such features are
* Picking up de arrow keys for movement
* Managing the snake and it's body
* Being able to eat fruit
* All the game over possibilities (screen border or biting itself)
It's important to remember that this project is for me to learn how to develop a game, I'm not looking for a direct tutorial in how to make the snake game, from the knowledge I have which comes from Coding Train mostly and from the questions that I'm making to chatGPT I am finding the pieces that will allow me to make the Snake Game.
